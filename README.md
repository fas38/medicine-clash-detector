### Medicine Clash Detector ###

In our country, people are always taking medicines in their own without even consulting
doctors. As a result, they sometimes take medicine which unbeknownst to them do more harm
than good because they might have a certain disease or the medicines are not supposed to be
taken together. This motivated us to build an application that will help people in not taking
drugs that clash with each other or harmful due to a certain health condition that they have.

This software product is developed for patients; keeping in mind the situation of Bangladesh. In
our country, most of the people go to the doctors however they like. This causes a problem
which is, the doctors who are prescribing the medicines for the same patient do not have any
idea what the other doctors have prescribed. As a result, there could be prescribed medicines
which could potentially clash with each other. This could be fatal. Our application can alert
users if they are taking medicines which clash with each other or if the medicine they are taking
might not be suitable for them because of their certain health conditions.

For example, one should not take medicines with the same ingredients from different vendors
or brands [1]. Suppose someone is taking Napa for some reason, he/she should not take Ace or
other medicine which have the same chemical ingredient that is Paracetamol.
Also if someone has heart condition he/she should not take any nerve relaxant or medicines
related to a nerve.

Theoretically, it should not be a problem, because the right way of medical procedure is that,
every physician must have to check the details a medical history of the patient they are
treating. But in our country, very few people have a complete medical history report and fewer
who will carry them when going to a new physician! So our physicians have no way of knowing
what the patient is currently taking and often they have no way of knowing which medical
condition the patient has other than very obvious one (e.g. pregnancy) or the one they are
treating.
So we think our application is a very necessary thing for our county. It can save lives. Many
people die or suffer terribly just because of this issue in our country. 

We were able to accomplish the following objectives -

  1) To build a smartphone application that would be able to alert users if they are taking
medicines that are not supposed to be taken together that is the medicines clashes with
each other.
  2) The application would also be able to alert the user if he/she is taking a medicine that
might be problematic due to his/her health condition (such as heart disease, high blood
pressure, etc.)
  3) To implement an OCR method into the application so that user would be able to add
medicine by just scanning the name of the medicine.
  4) To provide cloud and sync functionality so that user would be able to access his/her
account from any device by just log in.

Even though our application is only available for the Android platform right now, our future goal is to
make it available on other platforms such as IOS, Chrome Os, and Website etc
