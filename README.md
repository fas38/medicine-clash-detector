### What is this repository for? ###

In our country, people go to several doctors who prescribe different medicines. Sometimes this is a very harmful practice because some medicines can react badly with another one and they could both be prescribed by different doctors who do not know about the other doctors prescription. As a result, the doctor suffers because if something happens to the patient then his reputation will go down. And the worst thing will happen to the patients which sometimes can be lethal.

So our goal is to build an app for both iOS and Android platform(since these are the most popular smartphone OS) which will allow the patient to take pictures of all the medicines he/she is taking and then show them if there is any clash among them or not. 

The app will convert the image of the medicines into texts and search accordingly. We will use available API for this.
